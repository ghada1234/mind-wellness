---

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Samsung Seller Portal Account**
   - Sign up at: https://seller.samsungapps.com/
   - Complete seller verification (may take 1-3 business days)
   - Pay registration fee if applicable

2. **Development Tools**
   - Android Studio installed
   - Java JDK 11 or higher
   - Node.js 18+ (already installed)

3. **App Assets Ready**
   - App icons (512x512px)
   - Screenshots (multiple device sizes)
   - Feature graphic (1024x500px)
   - Privacy policy URL
   - App description and keywords

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Build Your App for Production

### 1.1 Create Firebase Configuration (if using Firebase features)

If your app uses Firebase (which it does for AI features), add your `google-services.json`:

```bash
# Place your google-services.json file in:
android/app/google-services.json
```

### 1.2 Build the Web App

```bash
npm run build:mobile
```

This will:
- Build your Next.js app as a static export
- Sync the build to Android project
- Prepare for mobile deployment

### 1.3 Generate a Signing Key

You need a keystore to sign your app for release:

```bash
# Navigate to android/app directory
cd android/app

# Generate keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore mind-wellness-release.keystore -alias mind-wellness -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# You'll be asked to provide:
# - Keystore password (save this securely!)
# - Key password (save this securely!)
# - Your name, organization, etc.
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Keep your keystore file and passwords safe! You'll need them for all future updates.

### 1.4 Configure Signing in build.gradle

Edit `android/app/build.gradle` and update the signing config:

```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file("mind-wellness-release.keystore")
        storePassword "YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
        keyAlias "mind-wellness"
        keyPassword "YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD"
    }
}

buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release  // Uncomment this line
    }
}
```

### 1.5 Build the Release APK/AAB

Samsung Galaxy Store accepts both APK and AAB (Android App Bundle) formats:

**For APK (larger file, but simpler):**
```bash
npm run cap:build:android
```

The APK will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

**For AAB (smaller, recommended):**
```bash
npm run cap:bundle:android
```

The AAB will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

---

## üé® Step 2: Prepare App Assets

### 2.1 App Icons

Create app icons in the following sizes:
- **512x512px** - High-res icon for store listing
- Icons are auto-generated in Android project, but you can customize them

  mipmap-mdpi/      (48x48)
  mipmap-hdpi/      (72x72)
  mipmap-xhdpi/     (96x96)
  mipmap-xxhdpi/    (144x144)
  mipmap-xxxhdpi/   (192x192)
```

### 2.2 Screenshots

Samsung requires screenshots for different device types:
- **Phone**: 1080x1920, 1440x2560, or 1440x3040
- **Tablet** (optional): 1200x1920 or 2048x2732
- Minimum: 2 screenshots per device type

2. Mood tracking
3. Meditation features
4. Journal interface
5. AI wellness assistant
