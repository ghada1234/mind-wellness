# ✅ Verify Deployment - Vercel Auto-Deploy

## 🚀 **Automatic Deployment Status**

If Vercel is connected to your GitHub repository:
- ✅ **Code pushed** to GitHub
- ✅ **Vercel detects changes** automatically
- ✅ **New deployment** should start in 1-2 minutes

---

## 📊 **Check Deployment Status**

### **Option 1: Vercel Dashboard**

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com
2. **Login** to your account
3. **Click on your project**: `mind-wellness`
4. **View Deployments** tab:
   - Should see a new deployment starting
   - Status: "Building..." or "Deploying..."
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for completion

### **Option 2: GitHub Actions (if enabled)**

If you see a checkmark/green status on GitHub, deployment completed!

---

## ✅ **Verify Changes are Live**

After deployment completes (2-3 minutes):

1. **Visit your site**: https://www.find-your-inner-peace.com
2. **Check sidebar menu**:
   - ✅ Analytics should NOT be in the menu
   - ✅ Should only see: Self Love, Mindfulness, Reminders, Water Log, AI Hub, Wellness Report

3. **Test the app**:
   - Sign in
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Verify sidebar menu is correct

## 🌐 **Verify Custom Domain**

After deployment:

4. **Check deployment** completed successfully
