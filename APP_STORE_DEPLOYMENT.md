# App Store Deployment Guide

## üì± Deploy Mind Wellness to App Stores

This guide covers deploying your app to:
- **Google Play Store** (Android)
- **Samsung Galaxy Store** (Android)
- **Apple App Store** (iOS) - Coming Soon

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Prepare for Production Build

### Current Issue
The app uses Server Actions (`'use server'`) which are not compatible with static export needed for mobile. We need to handle this.

### Solution Options:

**Option A: Disable AI Features for Mobile (Quick Fix)**
- Move AI flows to API routes instead of Server Actions
- Or conditionally disable AI features in mobile build

**Option B: Use API Routes (Recommended)**
- Convert Server Actions to API routes
- These work with static export

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep web version with Server Actions
- Use API routes for mobile build

---

## üì¶ Step 2: Build for Android

### 2.1 Generate Signing Key

First, create a keystore to sign your app:

```bash
cd android/app

# Generate release keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore mind-wellness-release.keystore \
  -alias mind-wellness \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Keystore password (SAVE THIS!)
# - Key password (SAVE THIS!)
# - Your name and organization details
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Keep your keystore file and passwords secure! You'll need them for all future updates.

### 2.2 Configure Signing

Edit `android/app/build.gradle` and add your signing config:

```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file("mind-wellness-release.keystore")
        storePassword System.getenv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD") ?: "YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
        keyAlias "mind-wellness"
        keyPassword System.getenv("KEY_PASSWORD") ?: "YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD"
    }
}

buildTypes {
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        shrinkResources true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    }
}
```

### 2.3 Build the App

```bash
# Build Next.js app for mobile
npm run build:mobile

# Or manually:
BUILD_TARGET=mobile next build && npx cap sync android

# Build release bundle (AAB - recommended for Play Store)
npm run cap:bundle:android

# Or build APK (for direct install or Samsung Galaxy Store)
npm run cap:build:android
```

**Output files:**
- **AAB**: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` (for Google Play)
