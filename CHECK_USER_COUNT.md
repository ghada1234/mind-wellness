## Why Your Analytics Shows Zero

If your in-app analytics dashboard shows zero users, it's likely because:

### Reason 1: No User Metadata in Firestore
- Firebase Authentication stores users separately
- The analytics page reads from Firestore `users` collection
- Users need to sign up AND use the app for data to appear

### Reason 2: No Users Have Signed Up Yet
- Check if anyone has actually created an account
- Test by creating a user: http://localhost:9002/auth/sign-up

### Reason 3: Firestore Security Rules
- Rules might prevent reading user data
- Check your rules in Firebase Console

---

## Quick Test: Create a Test User

1. **Open your app**: http://localhost:9002/auth/sign-up
2. **Create account** with test email (e.g., test@example.com)
3. **Sign in** and use the app
4. **Check analytics** again: http://localhost:9002/dashboard/analytics-admin
5. **Refresh the data** using the "Refresh Data" button

---

## Run Node Script (Advanced)

If you want to check users programmatically:

```bash
# Install Firebase Admin SDK
npm install firebase-admin

# Run the check script
node check-users.js
```

**Note**: This requires Firebase service account credentials.

## Expected Results

### If You Have Users:
```
📊 Total Users: 5

👥 Recent Users:
────────────────────────────────────────
1. user1@example.com
   Created: 10/20/2025 | Last Sign In: 10/23/2025
2. user2@example.com
   Created: 10/21/2025 | Last Sign In: 10/23/2025
...
```

### If You Have No Users:
```
📊 Total Users: 0

❌ No users found in Firebase Authentication

💡 This means:
   - No one has signed up yet
   - Users need to create accounts via /auth/sign-up
```

---

## Next Steps After Checking

Once you know your user count:

1. **If you have users** - Great! The analytics will show data once users interact with the app
2. **If you have no users** - Create test accounts to see analytics working
3. **Deploy to Vercel** - Your live site will start collecting real user data
